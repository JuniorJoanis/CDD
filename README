#Your users like the chemical inventory system you built for them, but sometimes they unexpectedly run out of a chemical and have to wait for resupply.

#After discussing this with them, you realize that many uses recur at defined intervals, and this can help you forecast when the chemical will run out.

#For this code problem, you will write the algorithm to predict when a chemical will run out. Please use Ruby (core library only) and include plenty of specs/tests in your favorite testing framework.

#Scheduled use
#A scheduled use has an amount, a periodicity, a start date and an optional end date
#A scheduled use's periodicity can be daily or weekly (on a particular day of the week)
#Given a current amount and a set of scheduled uses, predict when the chemical will run out
#If the last use brings the amount to zero, then return the date of the last use
#If any use makes the amount negative, return the date of the latest use that did not incur a negative balance




#Run the APP:  go to the console and run > ruby run.rb
#Run the test: rspec spec/
